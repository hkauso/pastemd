ðŸ¦€ pastemd
=============

`pastemd` is a small pastebin API/library that easily allows the creation of new pastebin sites with different frontends.

An example/template can be found at <https://github.com/hkauso/sealable>.

***

This fork uses a [Dorsal](https://github.com/stellularorg/dorsal)-based backend which supports multiple database types. Please see the [original source](https://github.com/caffeineee/pasties) for more current development.

This fork only handles the database and API routes (with Axum). It is encouraged you build your own frontend around the API or use the source to learn how to write your own pastebin API.
